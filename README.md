# Python (2) Bayesian Odds Updating Calculator


## Usage

1. Prompts "1" for prior odds ratio, "2" for prior percent prevalence

2. Enter first number in ratio [ENTER] then second number in ratio

3. OR if "2" selected, enter float n, 0.00 < n < 1.00

4. Prompts "1" for multiplicative odds ratio in form of single float

	or "2" for odds ratio in form of likelihood among positive population  

	vs. likelihood among negative population  

	(both integer numbers > 0)

5. If "1" chosen, enter float m, 0.00 < m < 1.00

6. If "2" chosen, enter first number in ratio [ENTER] then second number

7. Displays posterior odds and posterior percent likelihood

8. Prompts "1" for updating with posterior as prior,

	"2" for new task,  

	or "0" for exit
